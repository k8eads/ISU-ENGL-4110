## A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century ##
### Haraway, D. J. (1991) ###

Interested to see how Socialist-Feminism works its way into this paper

*A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature if fiction*

*The international women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object.*

*The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century.*

So far... seems as though this cyborg is a combination of what people think is happening to women and what has actual happened to women. This is dangerous because every woman experiences womanhood differently and in turn doesn't necessarily experience what people perceive as womanly. 

*They could not achieve man's dream, only mock it*

### WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ###

*Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church*

#### In Class Digestion ####

cybernetic organism - marriage of humanities and technology

*We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism*

Combination of different animals, more complex and versitle 

*Territories of production, reproduction, and imagination*


### FRACTURED IDENTITIES ###
*Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic.*

*There is nothing about being 'female' that naturally binds women.*

*Gender, race, or class consciousness is an achievement forced on us by terrible historical experience of the contradictory social realities of patriarchy, colonialism, and capitalism.*

*affinity not identity*

She is honestly coming up with some banger lines here. As a female I am really resonating with a lot of what she is saying which is so bizarre considering the time period this was written. She also puts it so eloquently in a way that is profound but honestly not that hard to digest.

**How does the rhetoric of technology intersect with rhetoric in regards to the female experience?**

*May scientific and technical workers in Silicon Valley, the high-tech cowboys included, do not want to work on military science. Can these personal preferences and cultural tendencies be welded into progressive politics among this profession middle class which women, including woman of colour, are coming to be fairly numerous?*

This blurb is very interesting and still quite relevant. I was in computer engineering for 2 years and a very large reason why I left was because of did not want to work in defense. So many of my friends who were also CPRE were going to go work for military defense companies and it just seems draining and morally gray. In one case a friend of mine went to work for a defense company with moral hesitations but slowly became "ok with it" because of the good pay and thought process of "someone has to do it". 

Whats also interesting about this is the small number of women in not only defense but technology focused fields. When in CPRE I was often times the only girl in my class or one of few. In these cases I also felt I had more to prove because of my position as a woman. I still face this in my professional life as an audio engineer. There will be gigs where I am the only female in terms of the band and people working. A part of this is highly rewarding being one of few but is also hard with the feelings of needing to prove myself and work harder to climb the ladder.

### WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ###
*Personal and political realms*

*I am conscious of the odd perspective provided by my historical position - a PhD in biology for an Irish Catholic girl was made possible by Sputnik’s impact on US national science-education policy. I have a body and mind as much constructed by the post-Second World War arms race and cold war as by the women’s movements.*

**What “historical position” could be providing “odd perspectives” for girls nowadays?**

### CYBORGS: A MYTH OF POLITICAL IDENTITY ### 
Shoutout Audre Lorde!!

**How does power come into play within the rhetoric of technology**

*Feminist cyborg stories have the task of recoding communication and intelligence to subvert command and control*

*Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century.*

Once again makes you ponder what exactly the rhetoric of technology is... I’ve personally been pondering what exactly rhetoric of technology is and at the moment I’m settling on its rhetoric related to application for a practical purpose. It’s also rhetoric that has to do with both the scientific and social. 

**What is a cyborg?**

*Cyborg imagery can help express two crucial arguments in this essay:*
- *The production of universal, totalizing theory is a major mistake that misses most of reality, probably always, but certainly now*
- *taking responsibility for the social relations of science and technology means refusing an anti-science metaphysics, a demonology of technology*
- *and so means embracing the skillful task of reconstruction the boundaries of daily life*

*Cyborg imagery can suggest a way out of the maze of dualisms in which we have explained our bodies and our tools to ourselves*

*It means both building and destroying machines, identities, categories, relationships, space stories. Though both are bound in the spiral dance, I would rather be a cyborg than a goddess.*


The idea of finding a way out of the “maze of dualisms” would be pretty great honestly. Not living in a world of duality would be highly beneficial and so much more intelligent and progressed. After finishing this article my main takeaway is to embrace fluidity and rejecting the polar nature of our world. Embracing this cyborg nature of blended living will lead to a richer life.

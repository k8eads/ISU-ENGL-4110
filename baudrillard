# Simulacra and Simulations
## Jean Baudrillard

> In Baudrillard's perhaps most famous assertion regarding such simulations, he maintained that events like the Gulf War of 1990 "did not happen." In those events, reality was so shaped by the media and so replaced by representations that the events might as well have not happened. All that people "knew" or "experienced" of them came to them through carefully controlled images.

I find perception and reality to be a really interesting subject of study so I have a feeling I will like this reading.

### The Divine Irreference of Images

> To dissimulate is to feign not to have what one has. To simulate is to feign to have what one hasn't. One implies a presence, the other an absence.

The thing is though which implies which because I can see simulation implying presence and absence. The presence of something that is not real and the absence of something that is real. 

Shoutout “Reals not real” By KGLW

> "Someone who feigns an illness can simply go to bed and pretend he is ill. Someone who simulates an illness produces in himself some of the symptoms"

This reminds me of the whole Catch-22 principle. 

> But what if God himself can be simulated, that is to say, reduced to the signs which attest his existence? Then the whole system becomes weightless; it is no longer anything but a gigantic simulacrum: not unreal, but a simulacrum, never again exchanging for what is real, but exchanging in itself, in an uninterrupted circuit without reference or circumference.

### Hyperreal and Imaginary

> Disneyland is a perfect model of all the entangled orders of simulation.

> Or rather: inside, a whole range of gadgets magnetize the crowd into direct flows; outside, solitude is directed onto a single gadget: the automobile.

> it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real.

> This is ultimately why power is so in accord with ideological discourses and discourses on ideology, for these are all discourses of truth - always good, even and especially if they are
revolutionary, to counter the mortal blows of simulation.

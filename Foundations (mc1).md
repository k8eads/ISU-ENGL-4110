## A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century ##
### Haraway, D. J. (1991) ###

#### What is the nature of technology and technological change and how are these rhetorical? ####

Within this reading technology addressed as the tool we need to move forward and progress. By embracing technology and embracing a blended lifestyle we can escape dualism and the polar nature of our world. 

This text addresses technology as rhetorical in two major ways. Cyborgs are a technology to fight rhetoric that portrays extreme and polar ideas that harm females and give more power to the majority (capitalistic, straight, white male in this case). This text is also rhetorical by using technology to change others. One quote that illustrates this well is as follows, “Writing is pre-eminently the technology of cyborgs, etched surfaces of the late twentieth century.” Cyborgs are liberated and trying to liberate meaning that writing (their technology) is rhetorical. 

#### What does it mean to be a human in a technological world? ####

Within this text to be human in a technological world means to be polar, while a cyborg is, “a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature of fiction.” 

By being a cyborg you are a chimera “theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism.” This means that you are more complex and versatile compared to someone who is human who would be simple and stuck. 

#### What is the relationship between the new and the old? How can we know what to believe? ####

The old is necessary for the new but not something that should be settled for. This is illustrated well when Haraway talks about how her “odd perspective” is shaped by her historical position. He odd perspective has been made possible by dark things that she chose to use as a springboard for change.

Ultimately it’s up to the reader what to believe. These enlightened cyborgs are going to be aware of the duality and necessity for change while those who are stuck stay ignorant.

# Postscript on the Societies of Control
## Deleuze

### 1. Historical
> We are in a generalized crisis in relation to all the environments of enclosure - prison, hospital, factory, school, family.

### 2. Logic
Shoutout Kafka

> In the societies of control, on the other hand, what is important is no longer either a signature or a number, but a code: the code is a *password* while on the other hand the disciplinary societies are regulated by *watchwords* (as much from the point of view of integration as from that of resistance). The numerical language of control is made of codes that mark access to information, or reject it. We no longer find ourselves dealing with the mass/individual pair. Individuals have become *"dividuals,"* and masses, samples, data, markets, or *“banks.”*

I really like how he frames this here. Still digesting what it means and would like to talk about this in class a bit. 

There’s this fight between discipline and control. Assuming he’s talking in context of Foucault. If a man is perceived as being seen he will discipline himself just in case he is being watched. This is the warden exerting control even though it not necessarily a forceful control. Its passive. 

> machines of a third type, computers, whose passive danger is jamming and whose active one is piracy and the introduction of viruses. This technological evolution must be, even more profoundly, a mutation of capitalism, an already well-known or familiar mutation that can be summed up as follows: nineteenth-century capitalism is a capitalism of concentration, for production and for property. 

> The conquests of the market are made by grabbing control and no longer by disciplinary training, by fixing the exchange rate much more than by lowering costs, by transformation of the product more than by specialization of production. 

> Marketing has become the center or the “soul” of the corporation. 

### 3. Program
Many levels of control we may not inherently realize.

> It’s up to them to discover what they’re being made to serve, just as their elders, discovered, not without difficulty, the telos of the disciplines. The coils of a serpent are even more complex than the burrows of a molehill.

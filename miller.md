# Technology as a form of consciousness: A study of contemporary ethos

> little work has been done which distinguishes the rhetoric of science from that of technology

A life-community or a culture. In this way, action is related to both the personal formation of mental character and the collective development of cultural character."Mind," as the anthropologist Edward Hall has observed, "is internalized culture."

Thinking of my own professional life I think of this as best practice or a standard way of thinking about certian processes. For example within my audio freelancing there are unwritten standards or culture for patching inputs. You can deviate from these general guidelines with a couple of werid looks.

The order is drums, bass, gtr, other inst, and vocals for those wondering.

This is honestly a big reason why I left the computer engineering major. I had a big issue with peoples outlook on DoD jobs and their inevitability. I've heard people skeptical about their work in DoD to hearing things like "if I don't do it someone else will."

Hall suggests:
- that technological developments begin as means and become ends, as extension transference absorbs them into the culture.This transformation leads us to believe in technological inevitability, which in turn strengthens and validates the transformation. 
- that, as we change from needing to manipulate the external world to needing to manipulate our tools, the tools come to seem less like extensions of ourselves and more like parts of the external world. We become alienated from our own creations; they become objects which must be controlled. We separate ourselves from our creations and lose something of ourselves in the process

**objectivity,** the belief that external reality is the only determining check on our knowledge of it.

action is essential for cause and effect

> the development of tools into machines.
^ main difference between primitive and modern technology

> Tools are literal extensions of the human body—they "are fashioned to unite man and
object." Machines, on the other hand, insert themselves between the person and the object.

> Machines are made by organizations, on assembly lines, and are used by groups. 
> Technological extensions thus become more and more distant from personal intentions and actions. 

This distancing is very dangerous and is something that we are dealing with in real time. 

> Although the engineer works in the open system of the natural world, while the computer programmer works in a closed system which is artificial, the engineer has come to think like the programmer because his technique calls for efficiency first. 


Engineering has lost all meaning because the processes are now part of the "closed "formal" system."

> The engineer closes his conceptual system to achieve certainty and efficiency

> self-doubt has never been a common problem for engineers
^ love this line

technology is a branch of moral philosophy

> But technology is not a "purer" form of knowledge or action; it encour- ages its own forms of consciousness, which are the more powerful just be- cause we may think them truer, or more transparent, or more objective than others. This is the insidious aspect of technological consciousness—it would
hold that it itself does not exist.

> The intersubjective view assumed by this essay makes perceived reality a matter of both personal action and social con- sensus; "character" is dependent on both.

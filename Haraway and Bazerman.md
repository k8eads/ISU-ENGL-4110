## A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century ##
### Haraway, D. J. (1991) ###

Interested to see how Socialist-Feminism works its way into this paper

_A cyborg is a cybernetic organism, a hybrid of machine and organism, a creature of social reality as well as a creature if fiction_

_The internation women's movements have constructed 'women's experience', as well as well as uncovered or discovered this crucial collective object._

_The cyborg is a matter of fiction and lived experience that changes what counts as women's experience in the late twentieth century._

So far... seems as though this cyborg is a combination of what people think is happening to women and what has actual happened to women. This is dangerous becasue every woman experiences womanhood differenty and in turn doesn't necessarily experience what people precieve as womanly. 

_They could not achieve man's dream, only mock it_

### WOMEN IN THE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT ###

_Home, Market, Paid Work Place, State, School, Clinic-Hospital, and Church_ 

#### in class digestion ####

cybernetic organism - marriage of humanities and technology

_We are all chimeras, theorized and fabricated hybrids of machine and organism_

Combination of different animals, more complex and versitle 

_Territories of production, reproduction, and imagination_


### Fractured Identities ###
_Identities seem contradictory, partial, and strategic_
